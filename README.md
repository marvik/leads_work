# Lead Conversion Prediction for X Education

## Description

This project aims to build a model that predicts the likelihood of a lead converting into a paying customer for X Education. By analyzing past lead data and identifying key features that influence conversion, the model assigns a lead score to each potential customer. This allows X Education to prioritize and focus on "hot leads" – those with a higher probability of conversion – to improve efficiency and overall lead conversion rates.
